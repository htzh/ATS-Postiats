# Atsreloc

A utility for relocating files referenced in ATS source code

## Motivation for Atsreloc

When programming in ATS, a programmer can often find it very
convenient to directly refer to packages that are located removely.
When ATS source code involving use of such packages needs to be
compiled, atsreloc can be called upon to copy these packages to a
local directory so as to make them directly accessible to the ATS
compiler (ATS/Postiats).
