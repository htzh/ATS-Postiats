This tutorial covers a variety of issues that a programmer typically
encounters when programming in ATS. It is written mostly in the style of
learn-by-examples. Although it is possible to learn programming in ATS by
studying the tutorial (if the reader is familiar with ML and C), I consider
the book <ulink
url="http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/INTPROGINATS/HTML/book1.html"
>Introduction to Programming in ATS</ulink> a far more approriate source
for someone to acquire a view of ATS in a coherent and systematic manner.
Of course, there will also be considerable amount of overlapping between
these two books.  The primary purpose of the tutorial is to bring more
insights into a rich set of programming features in ATS and also
demonstrate through concrete examples that these features can be made of
effective use in the construction of high-quality programs.\
