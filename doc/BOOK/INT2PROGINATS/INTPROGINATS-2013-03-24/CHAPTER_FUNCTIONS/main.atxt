Functions play a foundational role in programming.  While it may be
theoretically possible to program without functions (but with loops), such
a programming style is of little practical value. ATS does provide some
language constructs for implementing for-loops and while-loops directly. I,
however, strongly recommend that the programmer implement loops as
recursive functions or more precisely, as tail-recursive functions. This is
a programming style that matches well with more advanced programming
features in ATS that will be presented in this book later.

#para("Given an expression exp of the type #code("double"), we can
multiply exp by itself to compute its square. If exp is a complex
expression, we may introduce a binding between a name and exp so that exp
is only evaluated once. This idea is shown in the following example:

#atscode("\
let val x = 3.14 * (10.0 - 1.0 / 1.4142) in x * x end
")

Now suppose that we have found a more efficient way to do squaring. In
order to take full advantage of it, we need to modify each occurrence of
squaring in the current program accordingly. This style of programming is
clearly not modular, and it is of little chance to scale. To address this
problem, we can implement a function as follows to compute the square of a
given floating point number:

#atscode("\
fn square (x: double): double = x * x
")

The keyword #code("fn") initiates the definition of a non-recursive
function, and the name following it is for the function to be defined.  In
the above example, the function #code("square") takes one argument of
the name #code("x"), which is assumed to have the type
#code("double"), and returns a value of the type
#code("double"). The expression on the right-hand side (RHS) of the
symbol #code("=") is the body of the function, which is #code("x *
x") in this case. If we have a more efficient way to do squaring, we
can just re-implement the body of the function #code("square")
accordingly to take advantage of it, and there is no other changes needed
(assuming that squaring is solely done by calling #code("square")).
")#comment("para")

#para("\
If #code("square") is a name, what is the expression it refers to? It
turns out that the above function definition can also be written as follows:

#atscode("\
val square = lam (x: double): double => x * x

where the RHS of the symbol #code("=") is a lambda-expression
representing an anonymous function that takes one argument of the type
#code("double") and returns a value of the type #code("double"),
and the expression following the symbol #code("=>") is the body of the
function. If we wish, we can change the name of the function argument as
follows:

#atscode("\
val square = lam (y: double): double => y * y

This is called alpha-renaming (of function arguments), and the new
lambda-expression is said to be alpha-equivalent to the original one.

#title("Function Arity")

#para("\
The arity of a function is the number of arguments the function
takes.  Functions of arity 0, 1, 2 and 3 are often called nullary, unary,
binary and ternary functions, respectively. For example, the following
function #code("sqrsum1") is a binary function such that its two
arguments are of the type #code("int"):

#atscode("\
fn sqrsum1 (x: int, y: int): int = x * x + y * y

We can define a unary function #code("sqrsum2") as follows:
#atscode("\
typedef int2 = (int, int)
fn sqrsum2 (xy: int2): int =
  let val x = xy.0 and y = xy.1 in x * x + y * y end
// end of [sqrsum2]

The keyword #code("typedef") introduces a binding between the name
#code("int2") and the tuple type #code("(int, int)"). In other
words, #code("int2") is treated as an abbreviation or alias for
#code("(int, int)"). The function #code("sqrsum2") is unary as it
takes only one argument, which is a tuple of the type #code("int2").
When applying #code("sqrsum2") to a tuple consisting of #code("1")
and #code("~1"), we need to write #code("sqrsum2 @(1, ~1)"). If we
simply write #code("sqrsum2 (1, ~1)"), then the typechecker is to
report an error of arity mismatch as it assumes that #code("sqrsum2")
is applied to two arguments (instead of one that is a tuple).

Many functional languages (e.g., Haskell and ML) only allow unary
functions. A function of multiple arguments is encoded in these languages
as a unary function taking a tuple as its only argument or it is curried
into a function that takes these arguments sequentially. ATS, however,
provides direct support for functions of multiple arguments. There is even
some limited support in ATS for variadic functions, that is, functions of
indefinite number of arguments (e.g., the famous #code("printf")

#title("Function Interface")

#para("\
The interface for a function specifies the type assigned to the
function.  It offers a means to describe a function that is both efficient
and informative. Given a binary function foo of the type (T1, T2) -> T3,
its interface can be written as follows:

#atscode("\
fun foo (arg1: T1, arg2: T2): T3
")

where #code("arg1") and #code("arg2") may be replaced with any
other legal identifiers for function arguments.  For functions of more or
fewer arguments, interfaces can be written in a similar fashion.  For
instance, we have the following interfaces for various functions on
integers:

#atscode("\
fun succ_int (x: int): int // successor
fun pred_int (x: int): int // predecessor

fun add_int_int (x: int, y: int): int // +
fun sub_int_int (x: int, y: int): int // -

For now, I mostly use function interfaces for the purpose of presenting
functions.  I will show later how a function definition can be separated
into two parts: a function interface and an implementation that implements
the function interface. Note that separation as such is pivotal for
constructing (large) programs in a modular style.

Suppose that foo and bar are two mutually defined recursive

#code("isevn") and #code("isodd") are mutually recursive:

#atscode("\
fun isevn (n: int): bool = if n > 0 then isodd (n-1) else true

The mutually recursive call to #code("isodd") in the body of

When writing code corresponding to embedded loops in an imperative

An envless function is represented by a pointer pointing to some
place in a code segment where the object code for executing a call to this
function is located. Every function in the programming language C is
envless. A closure function is also represented by a pointer, but the
pointer points to some place in a heap where a tuple is allocated (at
run-time). Usually, the first component of this tuple is a pointer
representing an envless function and the rest of the components represent
some bindings. A tuple as such is often referred to as a closure, which can
be thought of as an envless function paired with an environment. It is
possible that the environment of a closure function is empty, but this does
not equate a closure function with an envless function. Every function in
functional languages such as ML and Haskell is a closure function.

#para("\
In the following example, the function #code("sum"), which is
assigned the type #code("(int) -> int"), sums up all the integers
between 1 and a given natural number:

  // end of [loop]
in
  loop (1(*i*), 0(*res*))
end // end of [sum]

The inner function #code("loop") is a closure function as is indicated
by the special syntax #code(":&lt;cloref1&gt;"), and the type assigned
to #code("loop") is denoted by #code("(int, int) -&lt;cloref1&gt;
int"). Hence, envless functions and closure functions can be
distinguished at the level of types.
")#comment("para")

#para("\
If the syntax #code(":&lt;cloref1&gt;") is replaced with the colon
symbol #code(":") alone, the code can still pass typechecking but its
compilation eventually leads to an error indicating that #code("loop")
cannot be compiled into a toplevel function in C. The reason for this error
is due to the body of #code("loop") containing a variable #code("n") that
is neither at toplevel nor a part of the arguments of #code("loop")
itself. It is straightforward to make #code("loop") an envless function by
including #code("n") as an argument in addition to the original ones:

#atscode("\
fun sum (n: int): int = let
  fun loop (
    n:int, i: int, res: int

  // end of [loop]
in
  loop (n, 1(*i*), 0(*res*))
end // end of [sum]
")

As a matter of fact, what happens during compilation is that the first
implementation of #code("sum") and #code("loop") gets translated,
more or less, into the second implementation, and there is no actual
creation of closures (for representing closure functions) at run-time.
")#comment("para")

#para("\
The need for creating closures often appears when the return value
of a function call is a function itself. For instance, the following
defined function #code("addx") returns another function when applied to
a given integer #code("x"), and the returned function is a closure
function, which always adds the integer #code("x") to its own argument:


#atscode("\
fun addx (x: int): int -<cloref1> int = lam y => x + y

val plus1 = addx (1) // [plus1] is of the type int -<cloref1> int
val plus2 = addx (2) // [plus2] is of the type int -<cloref1> int
")

It should be clear that #code("plus1(0)") and #code("plus2(0)")
return #code("1") and #code("2"), respectively.  The closure that
is assigned the name #code("plus1") consists of an envless function and
an environment binding #code("x") to #code("1"). The envless
function can essentially be described by the pseudo syntax #code("lam (env,
y) => env.x + y"), where #code("env") and #code("env.x") refer
to an environment and the value to which #code("x") is bound in that
environment. When evaluating #code("plus1(0)"), we can first bind
#code("env") and #code("y") to the environment in
#code("plus1") and the argument #code("0"), respectively, and then
start to evaluate the body of the envless function in #code("plus1"),
which is #code("env.x + y"). Clearly, this evaluation yields the value
#code("1") as is expected.

A higher-order function is a function that take another function as
its argument. For instance, the following defined function

Given a function from integers to integers, #code("rtfind") searches
for the first natural number that is a root of the function. For instance,
calling #code("rtfind") on the polynomial function #code("lam x => x * x
- x - 110") returns #code("11").  Note that #code("rtfind")
loops forever if it is applied to a function that does not have a root.
")#comment("para")

#para("\
Higher-order functions can greatly facilitate code reuse, and I now
present a simple example to illustrate this point.  The following defined
functions #code("sum") and #code("prod") compute the sum and
product of the integers ranging from 1 to a given natural number,
respectively:

#atscode("\
fun sum (n: int): int = if n > 0 then sum (n-1) + n else 0
fun prod (n: int): int = if n > 0 then prod (n-1) * n else 1

The similarity between the functions #code("sum") and #code("prod")
is evident.  We can define a higher-function #code("ifold") and then
implement #code("sum") and #code("prod") based on
#code("ifold"):

#atscode("\
fun ifold
  (n: int, f: (int, int) -> int, ini: int): int =

fun sum (n: int): int = ifold (n, lam (res, x) => res + x, 0)
fun prod (n: int): int = ifold (n, lam (res, x) => res * x, 1)

If we ever want to compute the sum of the squares of the integers ranging
from 1 to a given natural number, we can readily define a function based on
#code("ifold") to do it:

#atscode("\
fun sqrsum (n: int): int = ifold (n, lam (res, x) => res + x * x, 0)

As more features of ATS are introduced, higher-order functions will become
even more effective in facilitating code reuse.

precisely the opposite of currying. In the following code, both of the

Ackermann's function (which is famous for being recursive but not primitive

In functional languages such as ML and Haskell, a function of multiple
arguments needs to be either curried or translated into a corresponding
unary function of a single argument that itself is a tuple. In such
languages, currying often leads to better performance at run-time and thus
is preferred. In ATS, functions of multiple arguments are supported
directly. Also, given a function of multiple arguments, a curried version
of the function is likely to perform less efficiently at run-time than the
function itself (due to the treatment of curried functions by the ATS
compiler <command>atsopt</command>).  Therefore, the need for currying in
ATS is greatly diminished. Unless convincing reasons can be given, currying
is in general not a recommended programming style in ATS.
