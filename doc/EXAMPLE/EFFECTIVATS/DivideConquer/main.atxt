<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
Let's build a template-based package!
</h1>

##para('\

ATS is a feature-rich language, and dependent types, linear types and
embeddable templates can be seen as three of its most prominent
features. The richness of programming features can potentially make it
highly demanding for a programmer to rein in the inherent complexity
associated with ATS. In this article, I would like to present a
template-based package that is designed to (partially) relieve a
programmer of the heavy burden that is so often associated with
programming in ATS.

##para('\

The code presented in this article is essentially based on some library code of ATS available
<a href="https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/tree/master/libats/BUCS320/DivideConquer/.">on-line</a>.

<h2>Divide-and-Conquer</h2>

##para('\

In problem-solving, divide-and-conquer (D&amp;C) is a strategy that
divides a given problem of certain size into a collection of
subproblems of less size and then solves the subproblems (recursively)
and then combines the obtained solutions to the subproblems to form a
solution to the original given problem.

')##comment("para")

##para('\

Formally, D&amp;C can be given a template-based implemenation as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##dats2xhtml('\
//
implement
{}(*tmp*)
DC_solve(x0) = let
//
val
test = DC_base_test<>(x0)
//
in (* in-of-let *)
//
if
(test)
then
DC_base_solve<>(x0)
else r0 where
{
  val xs = DC_divide<>(x0)
  val r0 = DC_conquer<>(x0, xs)
} (* end of [else] *)
//
end // end of [DC_solve]
//
')</pre>

Note that ##dyncode("DC_solve") is the main function for
solving a problem. The following interface is assigned
to ##dyncode("DC_solve"):

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##sats2xhtml('fun{} DC_solve : input -> output')
</pre>

where ##stacode("input") and ##stacode("output") are two abstract
types for the input and output, respectively, that are associated with
the problem to be solved.  In the body of ##dyncode("DC_solve"),
##dyncode("DC_base_test") is called to test whether a given input can
be classified as a base case; if it is, then
##dyncode("DC_base_solve") is called to return the output for the
given input immediately; otherwise, ##dyncode("DC_divide") is called
to divide the input into a list of inputs, which are then passed to
##dyncode("DC_conquer") defined as follows:

')##comment("para")

##para("""\

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##dats2xhtml('\
//
implement
{}(*tmp*)
DC_conquer
  (x0, xs) = r0 where
{
//
val rs =
list0_map<input><output>
( xs
, lam(x) => DC_solve<>(x)
) (* end of [val] *)
//
val r0 = DC_conquer_combine<>(x0, rs)
//
} (* end of [DC_conquer] *)
//
')</pre>

As can be expected, the function ##dyncode("DC_conquer") is called to
process a given list of inputs and then form an output (for the
original input) by combining (in some manner unspecified here) the
obtained outputs corresponding to the list of inputs.

<h2>Example: Computing Fibonacci Numbers</h2>

##para("""\

Let us use ##dyncode("Fibonacci") to refer to the function that maps
natural numbers to Fibonacci numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. A
recursive implementation of ##dyncode("Fibonacci") is given as
follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##dats2xhtml('\
implement
Fibonacci(n) =
if n <= 1
  then (n)
  else Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2)
// end of [if]
')</pre>

We can also implement ##dyncode("Fibonacci")
as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##dats2xhtml('\
implement
Fibonacci(n) = DC_solve<>(n)
')</pre>

after giving the following (specific) implementations
for various function templates introduced in the above
template-based implementation of D&amp;C:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##dats2xhtml('\
//
implement
DC_base_test<>(n) =
  if n <= 1 then true else false
//
(* ****** ****** *)
//
implement
DC_base_solve<>(n) = n
//
(* ****** ****** *)
//
implement
DC_divide<>(n) =
  g0ofg1($list{int}(n-1, n-2))
//
(* ****** ****** *)
//
implement
DC_conquer_combine<>
  (_, rs) = r1 + r2 where
{
//
val-list0_cons(r1, rs) = rs
val-list0_cons(r2, rs) = rs
//
} (* end of [DC_conquer_combine] *)
//
')</pre>

Given the simplicity of the (first) recursive implementation of
##dyncode("Fibonacci"), one may not be able to immediately appreciate
the (second) templated-based implementation of ##dyncode("Fibonacci").
Let me elaborate a bit on this point. Assume that we need to
parallelize an implementation of ##dyncode("Fibonacci"). For the
recursive implementation, we probably need to rewrite it substantially
in order to parallelize it. For the template-based implementation, we
can simply choose an already parallelized implementation of D&amp;C
(while having little need for modifying the implementation of
##dyncode("Fibonacci")). In particular, code that implements
D&amp;C is generic and can thus be employed repeatedly in settings
where D&amp;C is the underlying problem-solving strategy.

""")

##para("""\

If we replace ##dyncode("Fibonacci") with a (much) more involved
implementation of some algorithm (e.g., in the field of AI), then
benefits from a template-based implementation can hardly be
missed. What is particularly beneficial to a programmer is that he or
she, with the template-based approach as is outlined above,
can concentrate on the specifics of the problem being solved while
largely, if not completely, skipping generic issues that are not
directly pertinent to the problem. For instance, the programmer can
focus on specific issues such as dividing inputs and combining outputs
while relying on the chosen implementation of D&amp;C to handle a
generic issue like parallelization. In other words, the template-based
approach can be seen as a concrete means that reduces complexity in
problem-solving by employing the very principle of separation of
concerns.

<h2>Building a Package for D&amp;C</h2>

##para("""\

I hereby outline some key steps involved in building a package for
D&amp;C that can be published
via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a>. Some basic knowledge of
npm is assumed in the following presentation.\

""")

<h3>##filename("mydepies.hats")</h3>

##para("""\

In general, a package should contain a file of the name
##filename("mydepies.hats") for specifying (static) loading of other
packages upon which the current package depends. The file
##filename("mydepies.hats") for the package being built is empty as
there is no issue of package dependency.\

""")

<h3>##filename("mylibies.hats")</h3>

##para("""\

In general, a package should contain a file of the name
##filename("mylibies.hats"), which serves as the entry point to the
package. For instance, the content of ##filename("mylibies.hats") for
the package being built is listed as follows:\

<pre>
(* ****** ****** *)
//
// HX-2017-02-22:
//
// Effective-ATS:
// Generic Divide-Conquer
//
(* ****** ****** *)
//
#staload
DivideConquer =
"./DATS/DivideConquer.dats"
//
(* ****** ****** *)

(* end of [mylibies.hats] *)
</pre>

Code that makes use of this package (which is given the name
##dyncode("effectivats-divideconquer")) is expected to contain a line
like the following one:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##dats2xhtml('\
#include "$PATSHOMELOCS/effectivats-divideconquer/mylibies.hats"
')</pre>

which introduces a namespace referred to as ##dyncode("DivideConquer")
and populates it with all sorts of bindings declared in
##filename("DivideConquer.dats") (for implementing the template-based
D&amp;C as is outlined above).  Of course, it is allowed to introduce
more than one namespaces at once.\

""")

<h3>##filename("package.json")</h3>

For each npm-package, a file of the name ##filename("package.json") is
needed for specifying various properties of the package. For instance,
the content of ##filename("package.json") for the package being built
is given as follows:

##para("""\

##para("""\

With a correctly formatted ##filename("package.json"), one can simply
issue the following command-line (from the directory containing the
package) to publish the package:

<pre>
##command("npm publish")
</pre>

Immediately after ##dyncode("effectivats-divideconquer") is published,
it is ready for downloading.

<h3>##filename("Internal Package Testing")</h3>

##para("""\

The code for testing a package from within is supposed to be stored in
a directory of the name ##filename("TEST"). For instance, the file
##filename("TEST/Fibonacci.dats") contains code for testing the
package ##dyncode("effectivats-divideconquer"). In this file, one can
find the following line for statically loading into the namespace
##dyncode("DivideConquer") all sorts of the bindings declared inside
##filename("DivideConquer.dats"):

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##sats2xhtml('\
//
#include "./../mylibies.hats"
//

Note that a path starting with the dot symbol (.) means that the path
is relative to the directory that contains the file (in which the path
appears).

<h3>##filename("External Package Testing")</h3>

##para("""\

One can download the package
##dyncode("effectivats-divideconquer") 
by issuing the following command-line:
<pre>
##command("npm i effectivats-divideconquer")

For updating it, one can simply do:
<pre>
##command("npm up effectivats-divideconquer")

The code for testing the package from outside is supposed to use
the following line (or one of its variants) to statically load in the
package:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
##sats2xhtml('\
//
#include "$PATSHOMELOCS/effectivats-divideconquer/mylibies.hats"
//

where ##dyncode("PATSHOMELOCS") is an evironmental variable
whose value is set to be a string representing colon-separated
path names. For instance, following is a typical setup for using npm:
<pre>
##command("PATSHOMELOCS=./node_modules:./../../node_modules:./../../../../node_modules")
</pre>
which reflects the way in which npm stores downloaded packages.
